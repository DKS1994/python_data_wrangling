# python_data_wrangling
Data munging or data wrangling is loosely the process of manually converting or mapping data from one "raw" form into another format that allows for more convenient consumption of the data with the help of semi-automated tools. This may include further munging, data visualization, data aggregation, training a statistical model, as well as many other potential uses. Data munging as a process typically follows a set of general steps which begin with extracting the data in a raw form from the data source, "munging" the raw data using algorithms (e.g. sorting) or parsing the data into predefined data structures, and finally depositing the resulting content into a data sink for storage and future use.Given the rapid growth of the internet such techniques will become increasingly important in the organization of the growing amounts of data available. Here we'll use python and it's libraries (pandas) as our tools. The ore from which we'll extract data will be webpages(html).

In this example I used the Yahoo Finance webpage for each stock collected over 10 years. You can obtain the same from the link described. Link=> https://pythonprogramming.net/static/downloads/machine-learning-data/intraQuarter.zip

There are 2 versions of python script. "wrangling_all_features" and "wrangling_two_features". The later is made for easy understanding of concepts used to import,clean and export data to a csv file. After understanding concept from the later script the former will be easier to understand.The inputs for our script will be semi-structured webpage and the output will be a csv file. We move further forward and label our stocks either "underperforming" or "outperform". These labeled data can now further be used for machine learning concepts.
